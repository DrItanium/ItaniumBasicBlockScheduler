This is a basic block scheduler implemented as an expert system for CLIPS.

It schedules converted Itanium assembly instructions. It will only schedule a
basic block correctly. It is not perfect but works well.

I wrote this as my final project for my expert systems class in my masters
program. I was trying to see if it was possible to use an expert system as a
viable way to schedule code.

Oh! You also need clips 630 or higher for this expert system to work.
