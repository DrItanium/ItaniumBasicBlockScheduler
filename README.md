This is a basic block scheduler implemented as an expert system for CLIPS.

It schedules converted Itanium assembly instructions. It will only schedule a
basic block correctly. It is not perfect but works well.

I wrote this as my final project for my expert systems class in my masters
program. I was trying to see if it was possible to use an expert system as a
viable way to schedule code. 

I have rewritten it extensively since then (I have a tag marked for the
original code) and it is really fast now. 

Oh! You also need clips 630 or higher for this expert system to work.


Running this program:

clips -f main.clp

Then follow the instructions and remember that paths are relative.
